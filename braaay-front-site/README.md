# sv

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`sv`](https://github.com/sveltejs/cli).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npx sv create

# create a new project in my-app
npx sv create my-app
```

## To Do

- Glidejs: Tenemos que poder cargar estas imagenes mobile. Tag Picture?
- Continue with other Tailwind-Base pages.
- Create the svelte this repo as a standalone project to use it with Vercel or Netlify.
- Mobile menu, needs to improve (no current place for cashback or account buttons)

### v2

- Be able to add favorite wines (I would use this, to explore and remember my favorite wines!).
