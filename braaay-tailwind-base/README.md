# Braaaya Tailwind Base

Intended for development purposes only.
The idea of this sub-project is to generate the minified and unminified versions of the css packages for Braaay.com
Yo be used as the css library for Svelte (mobile & desktop) & Woocommerce front-ends.

## To Do

- Order checkout page.
- Order confirmed page.
- Landing page.
- Login / Signup modal & Page.
- There is no way to access your account on mobile (hamburger menu?).
- Search typing results
- Add shrinking top menu on scroll.
- Add schema for product page.
- Glide carrousel is still sub-optimal (uses a placeholder that is fixed), why not use srcset for the placeholder and THEN conditionally load the image?

### (v2)

- Wine.com has a functionality in which, no matter where you are, a popup appears, and you can apply a discount coupon, with reflects on the listings of all wines.
