# Braaaya Tailwind Base

Intended for development purposes only.
The idea of this sub-project is to generate the minified and unminified versions of the css packages for Braaay.com
Yo be used as the css library for Svelte (mobile & desktop) & Woocommerce front-ends.

## To Do

-   There is no way to access your account on mobile (hamburger menu?).
-   Add shrinking top menu on scroll.
-   Add schema for product page.
-   Glide carrousel is still sub-optimal (uses a placeholder that is fixed), why not use srcset for the placeholder and THEN conditionally load the image?
