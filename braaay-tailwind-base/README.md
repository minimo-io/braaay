# Braaaya Tailwind Base

Intended for development purposes only.
The idea of this sub-project is to generate the minified and unminified versions of the css packages for Braaay.com
Yo be used as the css library for Svelte (mobile & desktop) & Woocommerce front-ends.

## To Do

-   Glide carrousel is still sub-optimal (uses a placeholder that is fixed), why not use srcset for the placeholder and THEN conditionally load the image?
-   Secondary Menu: Some of the important icons do not exist in the default Font-awesome 4 and they did in the Uncode icons. Maybe use a newer fontawesome class or other alternative?
